  elliptical arc
  (rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y)+
  
  Draws an elliptical arc from the current point to (x, y). 
  The size and orientation of the ellipse are defined by two radii (rx, ry) and an x-axis-rotation, which indicates how the ellipse as a whole is rotated 
  relative to the current coordinate system. The center (cx, cy) of the ellipse is calculated automatically to satisfy the constraints imposed by the other 
  parameters. large-arc-flag and sweep-flag contribute to the automatic calculations and help determine how the arc is drawn.
